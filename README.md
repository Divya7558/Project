Old_Book_Store_Project

The goal of this project is to design an online bookstore named Old Book Store.com 
that mainly sells all category old books. The book inventories are stored in mysql database. 
Customers can access the bookstore web site through the World Wide Web. Customers will 
be able to search the database to find the books they want, check the availability, and place 
the order to buy the book. From this website the customer can purchase books online. 
Through a web browser the customers can search for a book by its title or category, later can 
add to the shopping cart and finally purchase. The user can login using his account details 
or new customers can set up an account very quickly. They should give the details of their 
name, contact number and shipping address. The user can also give feedback to a book. The 
books are divided into many categories based on standard like 5th
, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, other books etc.
